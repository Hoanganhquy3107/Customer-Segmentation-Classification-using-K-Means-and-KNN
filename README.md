# Customer-Segmentation-Classification-using-K-Means-and-KNN

Perform customer segmentation based on consumption data using K-Means and predict new segments using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

🛠️ Technology & techniques:

Language: Python

Data processing: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, IQR outlier removal, Label Encoding

Algorithm:

K-Means Clustering: apply Elbow Method to select the optimal number of clusters (k), identify “Rich”, “Poor”, “Average”, etc. segments.

KNN Classifier: initial setup to classify new customers by cluster label

Model evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Accuracy (97.5%), F1-score (98.7%)

📈 Results:
Grouping 5 clusters of potential customers to suggest separate marketing strategies (discounts, premium products, promotional programs, etc.)

KNN model achieves 97.5% accuracy, good application in classifying new customers

Increase the ability to personalize business campaigns and improve customer care performance
